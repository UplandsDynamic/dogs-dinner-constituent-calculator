# Dog's Dinner Constituent Calculator

The purpose of this calculator is to provide 'Dry Matter Basis' comparison between commercially available dog foods, where the 'analytical constituents' are provided by the manufacturer 'As Fed'.

## Why?

Converting the 'As Fed' constituent measures to a 'Dry Matter Basis' basis allows for a more accurate comparison between wet and dry foods.

Specifically, the calculator assesses the suitability of the food constituents for dogs with kidney disease ('renal diet'), and for dogs with disease of the pancreas ('pancreatitis diet').

Default values for the calculations used to establish the suitability of the dog food constituents are based mainly on the information provided by the All About Dog Food website.
